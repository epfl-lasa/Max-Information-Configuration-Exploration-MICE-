## TYPE OF EQUALISATION
# equaliser: "select" # selecting the best sampleBatchSize * finalBatchCount number of points
equaliser: "none" # no subsampling

# NOTE: The 'select' method for equalising implements score based subsampling
# Atleast one of the following factors must be true
rarityFactor: True
priorityFactor: True
#-----------------------------------------------

## PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH DATA SUB-ASMPLING
trainSize: 2000000

# Determine the size of block around a data-point for calculating the point's priority as a part of its relevance score
qBelt: 0.05
qDotBelt: 0.05

# Filtering the recorded data
toFilterQ: False
toFilterQDot: False
toFilterTau: False

# To filter, we are using the Moving Average filter. Specify the size of the window of the Moving Average filter
qFilterVal: 41
qDotFilterVal: 41
tauFilterVal: 41

# For usual learning purposes: 
  # All filtering - OFF

recordingResultantTorque: True 
# True - The torque-sensor senses the resultant torque (i.e. the applied torque was -(recorded value))
# False - Otherwise


# Inverse of publishing frequency
dt: 0.005

useArtVel: False # set to True incase the robot (or simulator) is giving incorrect or no joint velocities. NOTE: These velocities are not filtered initially.
